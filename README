Rally Burndown Status Widget
============================

This is a widget for the Rally Dashboard.  Rally is an agile project management webapp.  
You can find it at http://www.rallydev.com.

The widget will fetch the incomplete tasks for each member of the project selected at the top of the 
Rally Dashboard page.  Then, the widget will calculate the amount of time left in the sprint and 
display the variance between the team member's remaining estimated hours of work and the actual amount
of time left.  If the team member is right on schedule, the status will be a '0'.  If the team member
is five hours behind schedule, the status will be '-5' and displayed in red.

That's it.  Feel free to fork the code or add suggestions.
